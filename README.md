Hola 👋!

I'm Pedro Piñera, a Berlin-based software crafter.

For the past ten years, I have been a hands-on and **adaptable problem solver**, collaborating with start-ups and e-commerce platforms and building open-source solutions like [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist).
My work is trusted by [Shopify](https://shopify.com/), [American Express](https://americanexpress.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), [Bloomberg](https://shopify.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Google](https://google.com/), [Monday](https://monday.com/), [Just Eat](https://justeat.com/), [Etsy](https://etsy.com/), and [Adidas](https://adidas.com/).

I'm specialized in **empowering developers by designing and building tools, libraries, and platforms** that are [fun to work with](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/10.2-optimize-for-happiness). I am also skilled in leading software projects and can manage, mentor, and hire software engineers.
